We have more than just a Facebook group–to keep in touch online, we use IRC and Discord. Both are _bridged_ to each other,
so feel free to join one rather than the other, or both!

We have multiple channels on ImaginaryNet (our IRC server), but our primary channel is `#compsoc`.

The full list of "channels" we may want to join include:

- `#compsoc`
- `#inf1`, `#inf2`, `#inf3`, or `#inf4` (depending on your academic year)
- For our Special Interest Groups:
  - `#cs-sigint`
  - `#networking`
  - `#hacksig`
  - `#sigweb`
  - `#lawtech`
  - `#sigcoin`
- `#minecraft` - we have a Minecraft server!
- `#tardis` is a student research project: let's do cool server stuff!
- `#random` we aren't sure what goes on here either
- Extra: `#cricket`, `#cooking`

## Joining IRC <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23sigweb&amp;hostname=irc.imaginarynet.uk&amp;port=6697&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.irccloud.com/invite-svg?channel=%23sigweb&amp;hostname=irc.imaginarynet.uk&amp;port=6697&amp;ssl=1"  height="18"></a>

Clients are needed to connect to an IRC server, but you do not need to create an account — these clients can be online
(e.g, KiwiIRC, or [IRCCloud](https://irccloud.com)) or installed on your computer (HexChat).

[You can pop in right away using KiwiIRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.imaginarynet.uk:+6697#compsoc), but if you already have
an IRC client installed on your device, just [click here](ircs://irc.imaginarynet.uk/#compsoc) to join the server.

The folks over at the [TARDIS project](https://tardis.ed.ac.uk/) also host a web client for you to use, called The Lounge (formerly _Shout_).
[You can login or register on this server here](https://shout.tardis.ed.ac.uk).

Be patient, with IRC you won't see any messages prior to the time you _connect_. Since Discord is bridged, you'll be able to see the chat history prior to your registration!
