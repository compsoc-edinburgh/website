Are you and your friends interested in a particular field of Informatics? Start a SIG!

CompSoc offers SIGs promotion, some money, support, and a place on the committee. [Send us an email]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) if you're interested in forming a SIG.

### Our SIGs

### Defunct SIGs
We have previously had special interest groups in these subject areas:
<ul>
    <li>Audio Engineering</li>
    <li>Blockchain</li>
    <li>Electrical Engineering</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Zines</li>
</ul> 

**Note:** Given enough interest, defunct SIGs have the possibility of being revived. If you feel like you would want to do so, [let us know]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact)!
