We have a small library where members may borrow books up to two semesters. If you'd like to borrow a book, take a look at the catalog below and click on the specific book you want to check its availability.

Library hours will be posted on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/chat).

If you'd like to donate a book, send an email to secretary@comp-soc.com.
