CompSoc Edinburgh is Scotland’s largest tech society – run by students studying at the University of Edinburgh.
Our society is a diverse community of computer scientists, programmers, and people who are passionate about the IT industry. People come to us for support in all things technology – we are the technology hub of the university.

We host monthly Student Tech Meetups, regular workshops, and quite a few social events with a touch of Computer Science culture. CompSoc also organises one of the largest hackathons in the country, Hack the Burgh - with over 150 attendees coming from around the world.

We are closely linked to The University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics, the largest in Britain, ranked the 4th best University in the UK for Computer Science by QS.
