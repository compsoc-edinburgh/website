We will be electing some positions at our October STMU.

- 1st Year Rep
- 3rd Year Rep
- 4th Year Rep

The election process is simple â€” each candidate prepares a short speech and then the members vote based on those presentations.

To find out more about what each role is responsible for, speak to the current committee members.

More information to come.
