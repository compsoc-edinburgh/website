            <summary><b>Dietmar Kuhl, Senior Engineer at Bloomberg</b> - Quicker Sorting</summary>
            <quote style="font-style: italic; display: block; padding-left: 2rem">
                Quicksort is a well-known sorting algorithm used to implement sort functionality in many libraries, but a text-book implementation of the algorithm is actually not that quick.<br>
                Some small additions can improve the implementation significantly. This presentation starts with a simple implementation and makes incremental improvements to eventually yield a proper generic and fast sorting function. <br>
                All code will be in C++ but it should be possible to follow the majority of the reasoning with knowledge of another programming language.

            <summary><b>CompSoc</b> - Committee Elections and Votes on Constitutional Amendments</summary>
            <quote style="display: block; padding-left: 2rem">
                We're holding an election to elect a new committee.<br>
                Candidates will give 1-minute speeches (2 minutes for President, Secretary, and Treasurer), and the audience may ask questions.<br>
                We'll also vote on some constitutional amendments. See below for details.
