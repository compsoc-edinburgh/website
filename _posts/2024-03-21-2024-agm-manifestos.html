<h2>Election Details</h2>
<p>
  Our AGM is happening on April 3rd, at <time datetime="2024-04-03 18:00Z">18:00</time> in <b>G.03</b> of the Informatics Forum. Yes, this is a different room, G.07 wasn't available. It's at the back-right as you enter. You won't miss on the day!
</p>
<p>
    If you want to vote in the AGM, you need to <b><a href="/join" title="Click to go to the EUSA CompSoc membership page.">make sure you have CompSoc membership</a></b>.

    We also allow people to run on the night, if you did not have time to create manifestos.
