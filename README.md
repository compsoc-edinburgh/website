## SIG: Web - website2017
This is [CompSoc Edinburgh](https://comp-soc.com)'s website, built by SIG: Web.

## How to test
It uses Jekyll. It also works nicely with Docker.

If you use Linux or macOS, run `docker-run.sh`. It will automatically build, server, and watch the directory for changes. It will listen on port 4000.

If you're on Windows, please contribute some instructions. You'll hopefully be able to read `docker-run.sh` and adapt the commands to play nice with docker-machine, or native Docker if that's your thing.

### Running without Docker
If you have `bundler` installed, type:

- `bundle`, to install the Gemfile packages
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` to host a local server that will watch the directory for changes
