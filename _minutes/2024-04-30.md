Meeting called to order at 5:00 PM. Vincent noted that the meeting was being transcribed to generate minutes later. Ali started the recording 5 minutes late so Fergus, Vincent, and Godfrey's statements were not recorded.

## Opening Statements

### Charlotte's Statement (read by Vincent)

Charlotte initially had concerns about the quick impeachment process, but after further reflection, agrees with the urgency. She finds Akrit's actions wholly inappropriate and feels the messages sent to him were reasonable, not unfriendly. She notes Akrit rejected suggestions at almost every turn and accused people of attacking him when they pointed this out, which is needlessly antagonistic. Blocking the president and repeatedly claiming to lead efficiently while asserting power over others is unacceptable. These actions have made Charlotte unable to trust Akrit's abilities as VP, and she would likely find more reasons to lose trust if she had more time to review everything in detail. Charlotte will vote for impeachment and encourages others to do the same.

### Anastasia's Statement

Anastasia doesn't understand what Akrit was trying to achieve by taking control of the SIGs. If he had issues with the handbook, he should have come to the committee. Everything was okay until he blocked committee members, which is an inappropriate way to resolve the situation. She is very unhappy with how he tried to handle things. Regarding impeachment, she's not fully decided but is disappointed with Akrit's conduct.

### Yuto's Statement

Yuto feels somewhat indifferent because the impeachment process seems extreme given that it's only the second week of handovers and the response is mainly driven by the outgoing committee rather than the incoming one. However, he agrees with Godfrey that Akrit taking responses as personal attacks is an issue he should seek advice on.

### Lewis' Statement

Lewis has nothing to say on the matter.

### Arin's Statement

Arin read through everything and finds taking responses as personal attacks problematic, as disagreements are natural. If every bit of feedback is seen as an attack, that's an issue. He agrees with Yuto that if they proceed to an EGM, there should be a clear motion for members to vote on, as it would be improper for the outgoing committee alone to move for impeachment.

### Lucas' Statement

Lucas sees both sides, feeling it's quite fast to impeach someone when people are still settling into roles. He acknowledges emotions were running high with exams and other stresses, leading to some exaggeration. However, he disagrees with how Akrit handled the situation, but thinks it's something Akrit can improve on. Lucas suggests it may be best for Akrit to take a break and think things through properly.

### Tomas' Statement

Tomas read through the message history several times and encourages everyone else to do so carefully. He found none of the messages sent to Akrit warranted the reactions they received - the initial messages were quite professional. Tomas questions whether he wants someone with Akrit's communication style representing CompSoc as VP and sending official emails. As the longest-standing committee member, Charlotte's assessment that Akrit's behavior is unacceptable should be taken as a strong indicator. Tomas does not feel comfortable with Akrit continuing as VP.

### Chris' Statement

Chris observes that Akrit seems to have a hostile attitude and takes everything as a personal attack. This is not something one can easily change, and Akrit has given no concrete assurances that he will improve. Chris doesn't expect the situation to get better anytime soon.

### Chives' Statement

Chives is waiting to see if a clear plan to address the concerns emerges during the meeting. It's important to have buy-in from everyone for the path forward. He wants to give Akrit an opportunity to present how he will improve the situation, as things have moved very quickly.

### Aurora's Statement

Aurora agrees with Chives that it would be worthwhile to hear how Akrit intends to do better going forward. She has nothing else to add.

### Agam's Statement (via text, read by Fergus)

Agam doesn't know how much to say. She doesn't like how the situation was handled but is unsure if impeachment is a bit quick. However, the reactions she has seen from Akrit worry her and make her wonder if he will be a good leader.

### SIGINT's Statement

SIGINT doesn't think this meeting should have been called at all, as it stems from a disagreement about minor issues. However, Akrit's response to the meeting being called has highlighted some traits that are unsuitable for the VP role. SIGINT acknowledges Akrit has some positive qualities like work ethic and a willingness to admit mistakes and apologize, but overall feels things have gone too far and there aren't compelling reasons for Akrit to continue as VP.

### TypeSig's Statement

TypeSig's wants to speak from the perspective of a group has worked on large events with CompSoc over the past year. Their primary concern is how this incident would have unfolded if it took place during the active semester when SIGs are running events and need reliable communication with CompSoc. Finding out the VP, as the main liaison, had blocked the President would severely undermine confidence in information being passed along and damage the crucial relationship between the SIG and CompSoc. TypeSig is large enough to operate independently and will do so if necessary - CompSoc should not make things difficult, as the relationship is meant to be mutually beneficial. 

### ProjectShare Statement

The ProjectShare committee discussed the situation and concluded that Akrit does not adequately represent them as VP. They agree with TypeSig's concerns about not feeling properly represented by their primary CompSoc point of contact.

### GameDevSig's Statement

GameDevSig is troubled by the lack of concrete plans for improvement in Akrit's apologies. He failed to outline steps he would take to address the concerns raised, instead fixating on how comments were personalized. Even when Akrit was told certain actions "reeked of power hunger," he incorrectly construed it as a personal insult and tried to redirect it back at the speaker and Vincent. This defensiveness and inability to separate critique of actions from attacks on his character is highly concerning.

### QuantSig's Statement

The QuantSig representative appreciates that CompSoc's current structure ensures SIGs feel respected and supported by the committee. However, Akrit's actions came across as trying to be the "boss" of SIGs rather than a collaborator. This attitude would likely drive SIGs to split off into separate societies, undermining the purpose of the current model.

### Edinburgh AI's Statement

As the key liaison between SIGs and CompSoc, the VP role requires engaging with a wide range of views and building consensus and trust. However, Akrit's communication style and responses have come across as overly authoritarian and dismissive of input. This "my way or the highway" attitude is ill-suited for a role meant to serve as a neutral arbiter and representative for all SIGs.

### CCSIG's Statement

CCSIG did not have much to add but reiterated their concerns about how defensive Akrit was in the initial handbook discussion and the resulting fallout. 

### Tardis's Statement

The Tardis speaker emphasizes that CompSoc is a volunteer effort, not a political entity. They are uncomfortable with the escalation to formal motions and impeachment processes, as it runs counter to the collaborative spirit of the organization. Even if there are some concerning statements from Akrit, the focus should be on working together to resolve differences, not removing people at the first sign of trouble.

### Ali's Statement

Ali started by saying "I'm like an AI model with a very, very small context window." Ali aimed to reframe the discussion from focusing on past events to evaluating the potential for future collaboration between Akrit and the committee. They underscored the importance of assessing whether all parties could work together harmoniously, as unresolved tensions would hinder productivity and the overall functioning of CompSoc.

### Cat's Statement

Cat has been listening to everyone's points and understands "both sides" of the situation. She acknowledges the concern that "things are moving too fast and that an impeachment shouldn't be called on such a small thing."

However, Cat believes that "what the problem is in this situation isn't so much the actions that happened," as those have been discussed and apologized for, but rather "the reaction." She notes that "so far in all the messages that have been exchanged," she hasn't seen anything from Akrit that "really proved that you've understood that what the problem we had was this reaction and how you were taking things quite personally."

Cat clarifies that by taking things personally, she means Akrit needs "to be able to separate someone criticizing maybe something you wrote in the SIG handbook versus criticizing you." In other words, when someone critiques Akrit's work, his response should be to work together to improve it, rather than reacting as if it's a personal attack on him.

### Akrit's Statement

The main thing Akrit notices is that people keep saying he takes things personally. He wants to provide context - he put the document in the channel with good intentions. He states, "If you think that was restricted, you should have seen draft zero that I did not work on." Akrit took the document's perspective because he wanted it to be efficient, aligning with his values of "inclusive, ethical, and efficient."

When others argued against parts of the document, Akrit saw it as an opportunity to point out existing clauses that addressed their concerns, aiming to be concise. As he puts it, "to me, the less words for the greatest effect was my goal." The repeated negative comments deeply hurt Akrit, as he was simply trying to do something beneficial for CompSoc. He was so worried about the potential fallout that he was afraid to even take a bathroom break, fearing it might lead to a "SIG exodus" that would be blamed on him.

Regarding his efforts to improve, which Cat had specifically asked about, Akrit emphasizes that he has been actively responding to the handbook feedback and didn't just allow it to become a "mini disaster zone" for someone else to handle. He has tried to address people's concerns in the document, and apologizes if his tone came across poorly, explaining that the situation was overwhelming until Yuto intervened and asked people to stop being defensive, allowing Akrit to finally feel he could step away momentarily.

Akrit has been taking the criticism personally because, from his perspective, the entire impeachment process stems from the handbook incident, which has been a continuous source of stress for him. He feels he has to appease 30 different people with his every word and action. As he describes it, "Because to you, it is a one-on-one to me. But to me, it's a one-on-30 people. And for every one point that you make to me, I need to say 30 things to appease 30 people and try and get my point across, that I did not mean harm. I tried to do good."

## Q&A with Akrit

### Cat's Question

Cat expresses that, from her perspective, the core issue at hand isn't the handbook situation itself but rather Akrit's attitude and approach when responding to criticism, a concern that other SIG leaders have also pointed out. She emphasizes that Akrit needs to learn to separate critiques of his work from personal attacks on his character. When faced with constructive feedback on his work, the appropriate, professional response is to collaborate with others to improve and refine the output together, not to accuse people of treating him as an enemy or personally targeting him, which Cat affirms is not anyone's intention - "We're all trying to work together here." 

While Cat empathizes that it can feel overwhelming to have so many people voicing opinions and concerns, giving the impression of being "ganged up on", she wants to reassure Akrit that there is no ill will or a coordinated effort to undermine him. She acknowledges that developing the skill of separating one's work from their core identity is an immense challenge for many people.

However, this is why Cat is unsure if the VP role, which requires constantly interfacing with a large number of SIGs and navigating strong personalities, is the optimal fit for Akrit both in terms of the core competencies needed and for his own emotional well-being, given how deeply this incident seems to have impacted him. She encourages Akrit to reflect carefully on if he even wants to continue in a position where passionate disagreements and the need to incorporate differing views will be par for the course, as this is unlikely to be the last contentious situation that arises. 

Cat concludes by referencing the previous commenter's observation that Akrit has a number of standout positive qualities that could be a real asset to CompSoc, and so perhaps a different role that plays more to his detail-oriented, execution strengths rather than being so diplomacy and stakeholder management centric would set him up for greater success and be a happier experience.

#### Akrit's Response to Cat

"I understand that I have things to work on, but I feel like I should have also time to work on it, rather than this be a be-all, end-all decision that you kick me out of CompSoc. It's... Yeah. I feel like I should be given more time to work."

### Fergus's Question Drawing on an Anonymous Submission

Fergus felt an anonymous submission about Akrit's history with other organizations was highly pertinent so chose to address it openly as someone with some insider knowledge of the incidents described. The question asserts that Akrit has displayed a pattern of unprofessional, combative conduct when faced with criticism that should raise red flags about his suitability for an intensive stakeholder management role. 

Two examples are cited. In one, Akrit allegedly rage quit a project with Hyped, after receiving pushback on a video close to a contest submission deadline. Per reports, his reaction was to send an expletive-laden rant accusing the team of sabotaging his creative vision and expressing his refusal to work under such conditions, despite the tight turnaround and high stakes.

In another incident, Akrit applied for a committee role with ProjectShare, another group. When invited to discuss the opportunity, he straight up told them he would refuse to attend any meetings or participate unless his appointment was confirmed in advance.  

Fergus claims to have directly reviewed the messages Akrit sent in the Hyped incident and while he will not circulate them without permission, he can attest they were incredibly inflammatory and inappropriate for a professional setting. The actual edits requested spanned 2 messages totaling maybe 8 points, some as minor as grammar tweaks. While Fergus empathizes that operating under intense time pressure is very stressful, it doesn't come close to excusing the bridge-burning behavior Akrit demonstrated over relatively standard creative differences.

The detail about Akrit refusing to engage with ProjectShare at all unless he was guaranteed an elite position also suggests an ego-centric approach to collaboration that is concerning. Even if Akrit felt provoked in the moment, the scorched earth tactics and personal attacks he resorted to are extremely difficult to walk back from and seem very similar to the dynamic that played out with the handbook and Vincent discord block.  

Fergus perceives a consistent pattern - Akrit receives a critique he disagrees with and instead of attempting to find a constructive compromise, he responds with histrionics, burns it all down, and then paints himself as the lone victim. While the other parties may share some fault, Akrit's reactions seem to always be a disproportionate escalation. Those who've observed this cycle before are very concerned that if the warning signs are minimized again here, it's only a matter of time before the next explosive falling out derails CompSoc's initiatives.

#### Akrit's Response to Fergus

"No track record should define the future. In the Hyped case, did they tell you that that was a competition deadline? Which means it wasn't even their deadline I was failing under the pressure of. It was a competition deadline that they should have given me materials for weeks before. And that I had realistically one day to provide them with the materials so that they could get 8,000 for their own society. In the Project Share case, I will not answer."

#### Fergus's Follow-up

"Okay. I think it is... I sympathize with you on that. However, the way that you responded was... Again, I can't show people this and take it as you will, but it was incredibly... It was very similar to the messages that we received on the Discord, which in a professional setting, which you continue to say you want to hold up professionalism, it just wasn't correct. And yes, there was some mismanagement on their part, but you have to... People make mistakes, and that's what you're trying to appeal to us here, is you made a mistake. But in your case, you just immediately cut it off and left it."

### SIGINT's Follow-up Question

"So I'd like to ask about this meeting you had. Did you make it clear to Vincent that this was a private meeting? Because as a SIG President, if I had a meeting with one of my committee members, and we were discussing society things, unless it was specifically specified that this was private, I would just assume that this is like any other committee meeting."

#### Akrit's Response

"I just made the assumption that it was private , because that's how I view everyone's conversations when I talk one-to-one, or even one-to-many, by people that I know."

Fergus notes they are running low on time and asks if there are any burning questions or specific points that need to be addressed.

### Cat's Follow-up

"Sorry, I don't want to sound repetitive, so I'm not going to repeat what I said already, but I think what we all are trying to get is some concrete things that we want to change going forward, specifically related to this issue of separating your work from you, and how you take criticism. So first of all, I'd like to know do you accept that this is an issue that you had, and how you responded? Do you accept that some of your use of language, such as saying that we were bullying you, or accusatory, or you see me as an enemy, do you accept that that language was wrong to use? Do you accept that that was an overreaction? And how do you plan to change if you think that's possible?"

#### Akrit's Response to Cat

"I do accept it as an issue. Because every time I thought that I'd sent out a message with good intentions, it kept receiving backlash. So I do realize that what I'm sending out needs to change. And in terms of improvement, that just means that I need to take a step back and properly read over what I've said, and then change it by its it seems too aggressive."

### Arin's Question

"So I think this is an important question, it says, I mean, I've read your messages as well, and I'm just curious, what did you and Vincent discuss before you sent the same handbook? Because it's come up in your messages quite a bit. You discussed with Vincent before you sent the same handbook, but then what did you discuss? Because I don't know or I don't think that anybody else was consulted before you sent it out."

#### Akrit's Response to Arin

"When I met up with you, Vincent, I sent you the third draft before we met up, so that you could read over it. And I remember that during the meeting that you did have objections, but then to each objection that I was able to answer and resolve that. So to me, I saw no major objections. And in the fact of releasing it to the SIG channel, that draft was clearly a draft, and it was sent with the specific intention of getting input. Because I didn't run it over anyone is because it was to get input. Vincent said that he would like to work on this later on, but I thought, what would the harm be in getting input, so that when we do come back to it, that we have stuff to work on, that we've got the view of the SIGs as well. Because up until now, draft zero, or up until the current draft that is there, has only been from a committee perspective. So I wanted to get that input as well, so that when we do work on it, that it does reflect what you want. And you have been doing that in the documents. I see the messages, and you are changing and adding the bits that you feel are necessary and removing what you don't think should be there."

### Edinburgh AI's Observation

"That's our response to what was said. I don't think the problem was with the document itself, but more with the reaction of all the comments with the document, right? How you interact with everyone in the committee and the SIGs. I think that's the main problem."

### Tardis's Clarification

"To clarify to everyone, Akrit did not send the document as a, right, here's what the rules are, this is a finished document. It was very much a please, can I have your input in this? However, I feel like our input that we did give was not necessarily listened to as much as it should have been."

#### Akrit's Response

"And I apologise for that, because I've been saying that the way I handled the feedback was because I put myself in the perspective of the handbook, to see that if there was an existing sentence that already covered your proposal, so that way we could group it into saying that this falls under that. Because I did personally believe that if we can get it, so that it's the least amount of words to read, but it has the greatest effect, then that would have been, in my vision, an efficient handbook."

### Aurora's Question

"So I'm more concerned about how you interact with people. So say you get a do-over, like you and Vincent come across a conflict, how would you deal with that?"

#### Akrit's Response to Aurora

"Going forward, it would be more professional. The reason I blocked you in the first place is because you sent a message that looked like a threat. The reason it looked like a threat is because I was texting Ali and Yuto about what just happened with the SIG handbook, why did it react so negatively. And Ali and Yuto were so supportive that it made Vincent, your message, look even more negative. And I saw that as a threat. But instead of acting on that, I sent another message to say, like, I see this as a threat. Like, am I your enemy? The reason I used the word enemy is very deliberate. It's not because I think I am your enemy. It's to gauge your reaction. Because the message I'm sending is, I don't believe that this is very supportive. And I'm putting that word choice in there to show you that. But then your response was again, negative. Like, really negative. Especially the quotes you used of some of the SIG people. And that was my response. Like, well, you've not addressed that it's a threat or not. So I'm going with, it is a threat. But instead of yelling at you in a public space, like the committee chat, or even worse, the general chat, I thought that blocking you, like silence, holding my anger. But please note that I did not block you and cut you off. I blocked you from one of the three socials that you have with me. And it did work. You messaged me on WhatsApp. But you messaged after posting on the SIG channel. Which is to me, unprofessional. Because I wanted to resolve this between us."

### Greg's Question

"I'll be quick. If this were to happened again on a do-over where you received a message from Vincent that seemed like a perceived threat, would you do anything different?"

#### Akrit's Response

"So my reaction would still be the same. I would send you a message saying is this a threat? And then I would expect a response like no, this is not a threat. So then I don't take it as such. Because a negative comment like that compared to Ali and Yuto's positive comment, that big contrast, that's what made me think it was a threat. And you didn't address that in your message."

#### Greg's Follow-up

"Would you still block him?"

#### Akrit's Response

"What would the alternative be? To go on the committee chat?"

#### Vincent's Interjection

"You did block me again on Instagram."

#### Greg's Suggestion

"You could ask a message saying is this a threat?"

#### Vincent's Clarification

"So that's two out of three socials."

"Well, okay. So then if you block me on the primary, then the secondary would be one option."

## Committee Discussion

With no more questions forthcoming from the committee, Fergus asked Akrit to voluntarily step out of the room so that the committee could have a candid discussion amongst themselves before moving to a formal vote. Akrit complied, leaving the committee to their deliberations.

One of the first items raised was a point of clarification around what exactly this vote would entail. It was emphasized that this was not a vote on Akrit's immediate removal from his position, but rather a vote to determine if the committee believes there are sufficient grounds to initiate an official impeachment process. It was further clarified that enacting impeachment would necessitate an EGM (Emergency General Meeting) where the entire society membership would have a chance to hear the case and cast their votes. Passing the current motion before the committee would therefore be a statement that they feel the matter warrants further investigation and consideration, but is not itself conclusive.

There was some discussion around the specific timeline and procedure for potentially calling an EGM, with reference to relevant sections of the CompSoc constitution. It was agreed that while the constitution mandates announcing an EGM a minimum of two weeks in advance, given the gravity of the situation, it would be more appropriate to allow at least a month's notice. However, concerns were also raised about allowing the process to drag on for too long, particularly with the summer break approaching - a critical period for SIG activities and prep for the upcoming academic year.

As committee members shared their thoughts, a general consensus emerged that Akrit's responses throughout the meeting had done more to reinforce and validate their concerns than to alleviate them. In particular, many found his assertion that he would handle a recurrence of the Vincent situation in the exact same manner to be highly alarming and problematic.

This is not to say there was no sympathy or acknowledgement of Akrit's positive qualities. Multiple members affirmed that Akrit clearly possesses skills and traits that could be of great value to CompSoc in the right context. However, it was also widely agreed that the role of VP specifically requires a very particular style of diplomatic communication and a strong facility for gracefully defusing heated disagreements. The prevailing sentiment seemed to be that, regardless of the outcome of an impeachment vote, Akrit would likely be much better suited to a different role within CompSoc that plays more to his organizational and logistical strengths rather than being quite so dependent on deft interpersonal navigation.

Elisa spoke up to offer a somewhat different perspective, urging the committee to put themselves in Akrit's shoes for a moment. She pointed out that he has come into the role and tried to hit the ground running, only to find himself in this highly adversarial situation before he's even had a chance to truly get started. In her view, the rapid escalation and overall tone of the proceedings could understandably put anyone on the defensive.

However, there was push back on this framing, with the argument being that the entire point of the present meeting was to give Akrit an opportunity to address the concerns that had been raised, but if anything he had doubled down on the very behaviors and attitudes that had brought the committee to this juncture. He characterized Akrit's responses as continuing to reflect a concerning inability or unwillingness to take on board critical feedback or admit fault where due.

A hypothetical was posed to Vincent, asking him to what extent, if any, he feels he would be able to trust and rely on Akrit as a partner if he were to remain in the VP role. Vincent answered unequivocally that his confidence had been thoroughly eroded and he could not envision a scenario where that trust would be restored.

It was also asked if there was anything the committee could put in place to give Akrit "a small amount more chance" while still holding the impeachment process as a potential consequence. Vincent's view was that the meeting itself had been that chance for Akrit to demonstrate his willingness and ability to change course, but he had failed to take it.

It was however agreed upon that the real sticking point is the question of whether Akrit has shown any meaningful indication that his behavior and approach will change going forward. In her assessment, his responses to key questions - particularly his statement that he would handle an identical situation the same way if it recurred - suggest that he is not truly absorbing or integrating the feedback he's been given.

As an alternative to immediately moving for impeachment, someone floated the idea of putting Akrit on a kind of probationary period to see if the concerns raised could be meaningfully addressed before taking the nuclear option of a full referendum on removal. They suggested framing this probation as a mutual agreement between Akrit and the committee to work on rebuilding trust and establishing healthier patterns of communication and conflict resolution.

However, this proposal met with some pushback, particularly from those who felt that the beginning of the summer break was a uniquely pivotal time for VP-SIG coordination and that even a trial period with a VP who had lost the confidence of key stakeholders could do significant damage. It was also pointed out that any impeachment vote by the society at large would necessarily have to be preceded by some sort of fact-finding and discussion period, so the committee moving to begin the process now would not be quite as abrupt or premature as it might seem.

As the discussion wound down, a clear if reluctant consensus was coalescing around the idea that Akrit, despite his evident talents in many areas, was simply not a good fit for the specific demands and constraints of the VP role. While there was no appetite for punitive action or personal attacks, the dominant view seemed to be that the good of CompSoc as a whole had to be the top priority, and that this likely necessitated a change in leadership, painful as that might be in the short term.

With all views on the table and a reluctant but firm consensus established, the committee prepared to call Akrit back into the room for the formal vote on whether to proceed with the next steps of the impeachment process. The gravity of the moment was lost on no one, but there was also a palpable sense of resolve and shared commitment to acting in the best interests of CompSoc and its members.

## Voting Process

- Link to an anonymous voting form shared via email
- Fergus White and Ali confirm the vote is single submission only and results are not visible to participants
- 5 min provided to complete the form 
- Votes cast: 21 via form, 5 by advance proxy, 2 via DM to Ali due to technical issues

## Vote Result

- Yes to impeachment: 24 (86%) 
- No to impeachment: 4
- Abstain: 0
- Total: 28

With an 86% vote in favor, the motion to initiate impeachment proceedings against Akrit passes. 

Next steps will be to plan details of an Emergency General Meeting (EGM) where the CompSoc membership will make a final decision on Akrit's removal in accordance with the constitution. Both Akrit and other committee members will have a chance to prepare and present their case at that EGM.

Participants are reminded that this initial vote is not a final removal, but a decision to move forward with the impeachment process. Akrit will remain in post during the interim. 

Meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM.
