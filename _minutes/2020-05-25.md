**Agenda**
* Handover conclusion
* Organizing social events
* Sponsorship

**Decisions** 
* Handover is finalized.
* Fresh Air Radio is going to use our GSuite in order to create a few email addresses; at no cost for us.
* In order to raise awareness of the society, we should host a Q&A event for freshers, along with SIGs.
* Ideas for other events could be online pub quizzes, video games nights, webinars, and workshops (technical + soft skills).
* The academic pals plan is more relevant than ever, and we need to make sure we can match applicants properly.
* We might still want to do room booking.

**TODO**
* We are going to have another meeting to decide on our sponsorship plan, but we need more execs (old and new) to show up!
* Prepare for exclusively online events at the moment - make sure we apply early to the uni freshers' week app!
* Begin planning social events and contacting staff/speakers/other societies.
