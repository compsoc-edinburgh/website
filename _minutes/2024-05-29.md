**Agenda:** Discuss Welcome Week Activities

Discussed Points:

- Pub crawl and Arthur's Seat hike are already confirmed.
- Previous year's budget for Freshers' Week was minimal, mainly covering prizes.
- Plan joint social events with SIGs post-Freshers' Week to encourage low-commitment participation.
- Plan a shorter talk to explain how CompSoc operates before the main presentation at the first STMU.
- Plan larger collaborative events in the second week to spread financial costs.
- Organize events for attendees who prefer non-alcoholic activities, such as a brunch instead of a pub crawl.
- Hold events on weekends to avoid clashing with the activities fair.

Scavenger Hunt:

- Last year's scavenger hunt was successful with about 40-50 participants so keen to do again next year.
- Teams were split into groups to recreate photos taken by other teams, which were then judged.
- Prizes given out from existing merch.

Arthur’s Seat Hike:

- Arthur’s seat hike will definitely be done again as was very successful last year.
- Need to ensure a first aid person is available for the hike and include this in the risk assessment document.

Brunch:

- Schedule a brunch during Freshers' Week to attract attendees.
- Introduce CompSoc with a short speech and make coffee ourselves.
- Book out either a room like the informatics forum or hold in the meadows.

Possible Collaborations:

- CompSoc x GameSoc: Book a room in AT for video games.
- Collaborate with Fleshmarket for a BBQ in Portobello.
- Do something with Hoppers

SIGs during Welcome Week:

- Project Share will not conduct activities during Freshers' Week.
- SIG leaders will attend CompSoc events to increase visibility for those SIGs.
- Suggestion to give out flyers, wear SIG merchandise, and interact with attendees.
- Consider a challenge for attendees to collect tokens from all SIGs, with prizes awarded.
- Host a general social with all SIGs to prevent overwhelming new students.
- SIG Fair to be held during Freshers' Week.
- Request SIGs to decide on their Freshers' Week activities by next week to submit plans to EUSA.

Action Items:

- Anastasia to compile a list of events with times, dates, and descriptions by next Wednesday.
- Lucas to assist Anastasia with this.
- Agam to create and distribute a poll/form to gather event ideas from members.
- Marton to consult with SIGs to determine their planned events for Freshers' Week.
- Godfrey and Lewis to create CompSoc flag.
